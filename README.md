# python-challenge
This challenge introduces Python programming for financial and election data analysis. Participants will complete two tasks: PyBank, which involves writing a script to analyze company financial records, calculating metrics like total months, net profit/loss, and major fluctuations; and PyPoll, which requires creating a script to process election data, determining total votes, candidate statistics, and the winner. The challenge emphasizes Pythonâ€™s ability to handle large datasets more efficiently than Excel, reinforcing key programming concepts such as file handling, loops, and debugging.
